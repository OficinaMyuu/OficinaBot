# Oficina Bot — The Very Serious Joke Edition 🤖☕

Welcome to the official repository of Oficina Bot. This project's main goal is to be slightly helpful and mostly hilarious.

Important note: The bot runs on coffee, optimism, and an unhealthy amount of Java.

## What's this actually for?

Mostly for making people laugh in Discord channels. Also for the occasional responsibility like moderating the snack cupboard.

## Commands (as interpreted by the bot)

- `/marry` — Propose to another user or their pet rock. Legal disclaimer: the bot is not responsible for the emotional consequences of marrying a cactus.
- `/rolemembers` — Counts the members in a role and adds 3 for dramatic effect.
- `/daily` and `/work` — Grants you imaginary coins that can be redeemed for compliments and virtual high-fives.
- `/leaderboard` — Shows the top richest users in the land of make-believe.
- `/pay` — Share wealth, because generosity increases your karma score (in this repo it unlocks memes).

## Joke of the day

Why did the bot join the band? Because it had the best Java rhythm section.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute, please submit a meme or a witty one-liner. Pull requests that include puns will be prioritized.

Thanks for stopping by — may your exceptions be rare and your builds be fast.
