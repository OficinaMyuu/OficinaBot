# Oficina Bot

This is the official repository of Oficina Bot, a Discord Bot developed using [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/).

## ðŸ“– Overview

Oficina Bot is a versatile Discord Bot designed to provide a range of functionalities for a specific Discord server, enhancing the experience of its users while keeping things nice.

## ðŸ“š History

The idea of a Discord Bot may sound a bit odd at first glance (indeed my worst decision), I tried to make a Discord Bot in JS having no prior knowledge about coding. After everything have gone wrong, I made a new bot in Java (this one).

## ðŸ”¬ Features
- `/marry` can be used to send someone a marriage proposal and start your romantic journey (you can marry to multiple people ðŸ‘€).
- `/rolemembers` allows you to precisely see all members within a specific role, even those roles with hundreds of thousands of members, yes.
- `/daily` and `/work` will grant you some money (required to marry and maintain your relationships).
- `/leaderboard` shows you the top richest users (global) you can compete against.
- `/pay` makes you feel better by helping others with money too :)

And there is a lot more to explore!
